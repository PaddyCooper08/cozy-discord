### Description
This css will hide the servers leaving a 20px gap where notifications and badges appear. Just hover on the server list for some magic. And a few more things. Probably.

### How to inject
Use a tool like [InjectMeDaddy](https://github.com/Pitu/InjectMeDaddy) to inject the css from the **dist/** directory. Either point to this repo or to your own if you forked/cloned this repo.

### How to build
1. Clone
2. `yarn install`
3. `yarn build`
4. Profit
